> Preserve data in the browser:

In this project Riziki Bulabo and Daniel Galindo, We applied the following elements:

- When the user changes the content of any input field, the data is saved to the local storage.
- When the user loads the page, if there is any data in the local storage the input fields are pre-filled with this data.
- We used the following data model:
- We created a single JavaScript object with all the data from the entire form and save it in local storage. We didn't create one local storage entry per input field.
